# MINI SEARCH ENGINE

**Project Overview**
This project is focused on creating a mini search engine. 
It utilizes data structures and methodologies that are a simplified version of what major search engines like Google or Bing use.
We want to create a search engine for text files(like our own "Google" for documents).
To commit this , we have created a folder with text files and have added samples.txt files .

**What to Learn**
We will Understand the methods in C++ and how we have applied all the relevant topics from c++ in our code to make our "Mini Search Engine" of five Text File and how it searches through the hundreds of search elements for every "search" we make and gives our result.


**Core Concepts Implemented**:
 Object-oriented programming: Implemented classes and structs to encapsulate data and functionality.
 Data structures: Utilized unordered maps, tries, and heaps for efficient data storage and retrieval.
 Project organization: Maintained a well-structured project layout for improved maintainability.
